### RS232
- Pros
	- Commonly available in legacy devices
		- Used to connect PC to
			- Dumb terminals
			- Internet
			- Mouce
			- Printer
			- Another PC
			- Microcontroller
	- Less number of wires (3 to be specific) compared to parallel or USB therefore inexpensive
	- Moderate distance communication (50 ft max) where as USB is only 16ft max
	- better noise immunity due to its higher voltage levels
	- supports hardware control flow (RTS/CTS)
	- easier to electrically isolate than USB, which can be a significant advantage when working with high-voltage or noisy equipment (communicating equipment have their own power supplies while still being able to communicate with each other)
- Cons
	- Cannot connect more than two devices
	- Slow speed (max 20,000 bits/s)
	- Very long lines need differential interface (RS485) 
		- RS485 uses two complementary signals to transmit data
		- RS232, which uses a single-ended signal where the voltage level on one wire is compared to a common ground
- RS232 (Recommended Standard) defines
	- Names and functions of the signals
	- Electrical characteristics of signals
		- Logic 0 +3 to +25 V
		- Logic 1 -3 to -25 V
		- - 3 to +3 V undefined
		- O/C V <25 V w.r.t to Ground
		- S/C I 500mA driver should be able to drive
	- Mechanical standard (size, shape, pin assignment)
		- 9 pin

- Baud rate upto 20Kbps, cable length upto 15m
- Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) - computer, terminals, printers
- Data communication Equipment (DCE) - modem
- ![[Pasted image 20240117003344.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20240117003507.png]]
- RS232 uses different voltage levels than TTL, this conversion is done by the MAX232 chip

**Modem Configuration**
Communication between two DTE using DCE over PSTN (Public switched telephone network)
![[Pasted image 20240208150052.png]]
Modem (Modulator Demodulator)
- Modulates outgoing digital signals to analog signals
- Demodulates incoming analog signals to digital signals
Two different types of modulation
- send information by making the peaks of a wave bigger or smaller, that's called **amplitude modulation** or AM
	![[Pasted image 20240208151653.png]]
- if you send information by changing how often the peaks travel, that's **frequency modulation** or FM
	![[Pasted image 20240208151717.png]]

A straight-through cable is used to connect a DTE (e.g. computer) to a DCE (e.g. modem), all signals in one side connected to the corresponding signals in the other side in a one-to-one basis. A crossover (null-modem) cable is used to connect two DTE directly, without a modem in between.

In DTE / DCE communication, RTS (Request to Send) is an output on the DTE and input on the DCE. CTS (Clear to Send) is the answering signal coming from the DCE. Before sending a data, the DTE asks permission by setting its RTS output to high. No data will be sent until the DCE grants permission by using the CTS line. The DTE uses the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal to indicate it is ready to accept information, whereas the DCE uses the DSR signal for the same purpose. DTR/DSR are normally ON or OFF for the whole connection session (e.g. Off-hook), while RTS/CTS are ON or OFF for each data transmission. DCD (Data Carrier Ready) is used by the modem when a connection has been established with remote equipment, while RI (Ring Indicator) is used by the modem to indicate a ring signal from telephone line.

**Null Modem Configuration**
- To connect two DTE directly
- Different ways to connect
	- No handshake
		![[Pasted image 20240117100750.png]]
		- No hardware flow control, only software flow control
			- If the DTE checks the DSR signal before sending data, and the DSR line is not connected, the software might interpret this as the DCE not being ready to receive data and therefore not send any data.
			- If the software checks the CD signal, it might interpret the lack of a high signal as the DCE not having a valid carrier, and therefore not send any data
			- The same holds for the RTS/CTS handshaking sequence. If the software on both sides is well structured, the RTS output is set high and then a waiting cycle is started until a ready signal is received on the CTS line. This causes the software to hang because no physical connection is present to either CTS line to make this possible.
			- Flow control is only possible with software flow control using the XOFF (ASCII 19)and XON (ASCII 17) characters.
		- Used for
			- Data-only traffic on the cross connected RxD/TxD lines
			- When communicating with devices which do not have modem control signals like electronic measuring equipment
	- Loop Back Handshaking
			![[Pasted image 20240117102657.png]]
		- Used to trick software that checks control signals
		- The assumption is, that if software has been written to check the DSR line to test communication availability, it will probably also set the DTR output to indicate its own state.
		- it has no functional enhancements over the no handshake null-modem other than being able to handle more software
		- faking the data flow may cause unexpected data losses when the receiver reaches its limit
	- Full Handshaking
		![[Pasted image 20240208161404.png]]
		- Proper hardware flow control makes it possibel to achieve very high communication speeds


## UART/USART
- Purpose (acts as a iterface between DTE and RS232 protocol)
	- convert data between parallel and serial forms
- modes in atmega 328p
	- Asynchronous Normal Mode
	- Asynchronous Double Speed Mode
	- Synchronous Mode (Three wire)
	- Multiprocessor mode
### UART

- since there is no shared clock transmitter and receiver must transmit at the same known speed
- UART uses clock that is 16 times bit frequency
	- clock drift
- they should agree on the same frame structure for data to make sense
- to signal the start of transmission, transmitter sends a start bit
- parity
	- even = makes the frame have even number of ones
	- odd = makes the frame have odd number of ones
- Baud rates from 960bps to 57.6kbps (common - 19200, 9600, 4800, 2400, 1200 bps)
- character size: 5 to 9 bits
- 1 start bit
- 1 or 2 stop bits
- optional parity bit

For serial usart
- 3 groups of registers
	- Baud Rate Registers (UBRRH, UBRRL)
		- ![[Pasted image 20240117004411.png]]
	- Control Status Registers (, UCSRB, UCSRC)
		- UCSRA
			- RXC - 1 when receive buffer has unread data
			- TXC - 1 when no new data in transmit buffer
			- UDRE - 1 when USART data register is empty
			- FE - 1 when there is frame error
			- PE - 1 when there is data overrun (another byte of data arrives even before the previous byte has not been read from the UART's receive buffer)
			- U2X - 1 to double transmission speed
			- MPCPM - 1 to enable multi processor com mode
		- UCSRB
			- TXEN - Enable USART transmitter
			- RXEN - Enable USART receiver
		- UCSRC
			- UMSEL - To select USART mode
				- 0 for asynchronous
				- 1 for synchronous
			- URSEL - Must be set to one to write to UCSRC
			- UPM0:1 - Parity Mode
			- USBS - Select stop mode
	- Data Register (UDR)



Steps for serial usart
1. Initialising port
```c

void  usart_init(){

    /* set UBRR value = 16000000/(16 * 9600) - 1*/
    unsigned char ubrr = 103;

    /*set baud rate*/
    UBRR0H = (unsigned char) (ubrr >> 8);
    UBRR0L = (unsigned char) (ubrr);

    /*Enable receiver and transmitter*/
    UCSR0B = (1 << RXEN0) | (1 << TXEN0);

    /*Set frame format: 8 data, 1 stop bit*/
    UCSR0C = (1 << UCSZ01) | (3 << UCSZ00);
}
```
2. Sending a character
```c
void usart_send(unsigned char data){

    /* Wait for empty transmit buffer */
    while(!(UCSR0A & (1 << UDRE0) ));

    /* Put the data into buffer, sends the  data */
    UDR0 = data;
}
```
3. Receiving a character
```c
unsigned char usart_receive(){
    /* Wait for the data to be received */
    while(!(UCSR0A & (1 << RXC0)));

    /* Get and return received data from buffer */
    return UDR0;
}
```

### Setting Standard Streams in C for USART
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	usart_init();
	stdout = fdevopen(usart_send, NULL);
	stdin = fdevopen(NULL, usart_receive);

	// use printf and scanf as usual
}
```
