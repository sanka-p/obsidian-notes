- Maps one symbol with another
	- Monoalphabetic - mapping is one to one
		- [[Additive Cipher]]
		- [[Multiplicative Cipher]]
		- [[Affine Cipher]]
	- Polyalphabetic - mapping is one to many
		- [[Autokey Cipher]]
		- [[Playfair Cipher]]
		- [[Vigenere Cipher]]
		- Hill Cipher

Polyalphabetic is Resistant to frequency attacks as it smoothens the frequency graph
