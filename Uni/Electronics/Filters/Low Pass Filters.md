$A_{max}$ is the maximum allowed variation in the passband. typically about 0.5 - 3 dB
$A_{min}$ is the minimum attenuation allowed in the stopband. typically 20 - 100 dB
$\omega_p$ - $\omega_s$ = transition band
We can measure the sharpness of the low pass filter using the selectivity factor
$$Selectivity\:Factor = \frac{\omega_s}{\omega_w}$$
The passband, stopband, $A_{max}$, $A_{min}$ define the order of the filter:
- Butterworth - Maximally flat pass band
- Chebyshev - Small transition band, but ripples in pass band
- Bessel
- Elliptical
