The transfer function (transmission) of a filter can be given as:
$$T(s) = \frac{V_o(s)}{V_i(s)}$$
The gain can be expressed in decibels (dB) as
$$G(\omega) = 20\log|T(j\omega)|$$

pass band - filter transmission is unity
stop band - filter transmission is zero

Four type of filters with ideal brick wall responses
